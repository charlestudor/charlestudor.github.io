Five adventurers were minding their own business when they were stalked by a shadowy figure.

Upon noticing the figure, it approaches and offers a smoldering note. It reads:

"I, Duke Gudren Heartthorne, require you to immediately attend me at my castle. I have a mission of the utmost importance, and I am in need of your particular skills. Several valuable objects of mine have been stolen, and you are to return them for me.

Why should you obey me? I know your secret, and I know your desires. I have the ability to grant them all, and I will.

Make your way to the *Misty Forest* on the *Sword Coast* at once, and we will proceed."

As noted later by a perceptive character, all five adventurers surely possess the power to read the basic Common language.

Some reluctantly, others eagerly, the five make their way towards their destination to see what the Duke has in store for them....
