## A Forboding Note

Following the defeat of the attacking guards and mysterious woman in the last session, the party find among their possessions 19 gold, two potions, (one healing, and one unknown orange potion) and a hastily scratched out note.

Upon reading and being impressed by the quality of this note, the party decide to depart immediately to avoid more encounters with the Kingfishers. They carry the mysterious woman a short distance into the forest, planning to interrogate her and learn more about their pursuers.

## Last Breath Revenge

Upon beginning their interrogation, the party quickly notice a problem - the woman appears to have swallowed a hidden poison, and seems to be on death's door!

Acting quickly, Tide and Brutus decide to force feed her with the orange potion, believing it may offer a chance to save their would-be informant.

Unfortunately for them, the potion turned out to be a *Potion of Fire Breath*, and with her last, the woman breathes devestating fire at Brutus and Tide, and setting a nearby pine tree on fire, much to the distress of Dally.

Tide and Brutus are knocked unconscious from the breath, and are in dire straits. Tansin reluctantly feeds the healing potion to Tide, and the party manage to stabilise Brutus, who remains unconscious.

Carrying Brutus together, the party flee the Misty Forest which is now clearly ablaze from their misbegotten antics! They head towards the Trade Way, a route they believe will be the fastest to get to the nearest town and away from the fire they started.

## The Cavern of the Ferocious Lizards

After fleeing the forest carrying the giant sized Brutus, Dally manages to find a cave for the group to rest in. Unfortunately for them, the cave is already home to a worthy foe - several rather small lizards.

After tentatively scouting out the lizards for several hours, the group eventually decide to be brave and engage. The bloody battle raged throughout the day, at the end of which the lizards were barely defeated. Brutus regained consciousness to find the party joyfully celebrating over the corpses of the small lizard family.

The group earned 260XP from defeating 3 Lizards and 2 Giant lizards.

## The Trade Way - A suspicious observer

After a long, overnight, hard earned rest, the group set out towards the Trade Way once again.  Along the way, Betty is hard at work "improving" the noblewoman's dress found in the forest. 

They finally reach the road, but encountered a suspicious Orc watching the road closely.

After stepping on a loud twig, Tide alerts the orc to their presence, and they engage in battle. The group earn 450XP for defeating the Orc.

The orc has in his possession some gold, as well as a magical gem which turns out to be an Earth Elemental Gem.

## The Trade Way - Onward to Daggerford

After defeating the orc, the group set off towards Daggerford. Dally has come to an agreement with Betty to borrow her dress, and she does his makeup to form a complete disguise.

Rather than walking the entire way, they decide to force a poor farmer to take them along, imposing themselves on his poor donkey and cart full of marrows.

The group reach Daggerford, and cleverly decide to hide their most conspicious members - Betty and Dally. Past the guard and into the town they go... The party receive 500XP for reaching Daggerford.
