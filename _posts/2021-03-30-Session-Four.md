## Entry to Daggerford

Riding along in their acquisitioned cart, the group arrives near the market in central Daggerford. Dally and Betty leave their hiding place in the back of the cart, and the group soon finds themselves the center of attention - it appears that the group's disguises have made themselves even more conspicuous to the local farmers and peasants!

Accosting a local, the group demand information on *Rallom*, the contact previously mentioned by Steldun. They learn that he can be regularly found at *The Happy Cow Tavern* in Daggerford, although they might find themselves unwelcome there as it is primarily a tavern for local farmers, honest men of the soil.

The party decide to travel there immediately, and Dally makes use of Betty's long bedroll to hide his high-profile appearance from the locals.
