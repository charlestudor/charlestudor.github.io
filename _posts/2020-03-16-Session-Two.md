## Further into the forest

Following the encounter with the bandits, the party regroups and decides to move swiftly onwards in case companions of the slain bandits or dog arrive.

The group decide to head North West towards the edge of the forest, hoping to follow the banks of the river to arrive at their next destination, *Daggerford*.

## Guards Approach!

Uncharacteristically, Brutus manages to detect trouble approaching, giving the party time to react. Approaching voices can be heard, and the adventurers react immediately:

- Betty drunkenly stumbles into a nearby bush, her short gnome legs waving precariously and still quite visible.
- Tansin effortly blends in with a nearby tree, like only a wood elf can.
- Tide quickly and stealthily moves to a dark patch of undergrowth nearby and begins to converse with Brutus, urging him to hide.
- Dally decides to embrace his a new interest in dendrology, taking a keen interest in a nearby pine tree.

- After much inspection, Dally decides to climb the tree.
- Brutus stands out in the open, making little or no attempt to hide. His large form is made more apparant to the arriving group due to his loud conversation with Tide in the undergrowth.

## Guards Confront!

Despite the groups heroic efforts to hide, the newcomers immediately call out to confront Brutus.

The newcomers can be seen clearly now - two guards dressed in the uniforms of the local town of Daggerford, with them a woman who looks in deep distress.

The guards call out to Brutus and demand the party reveals themselves at once, not including those already in sight. They claim to be guards investigating reports of bandits, and with them a woman who claims to be a victim of the bandit theft of her prized dress.

The two groups have a tense standoff, the guards wary of a group who look suspiciously like bandits, and the adventurers wary of the guards' demands to drop their weapons. The situation is not helped by the woman's insistence that this is the group who stole her dress, nor the fact that Tansin is actually in possession of the dress in question.

Eventually the group agrees to parley, and leaves their weapons on the ground a short distance away. They approach the guards to try to settle the misunderstanding. As Tansin gets closer to the guards to bring them the dress, he inspects them for signs of their legitimacy. He spots a small tattoo of a bird on the leaders wrist.

The guards (who have been joined by a third), claim that they will sort out the issue at their nearby camp, and demand the group travel with them a bit further. They however insist the group does not retrieve their weapons, as they will not need them in the guards camp.

The group is understandably not content with this suggestion. Tansin decides to ask the guard about the meaning of his tattoo, trying to ~~subtly~~ signal to the others of its  existence. The second the tattoo is mentioned, the guards immediately turn hostile and battle commences.

The group manage to overcome the guards (and mysterious woman), earning 250XP. The group attempts to leave the mysterious woman alive to learn more about their purpose...
