## The Duke's Manor

The session begins by following Brutus MadraBeag as he concludes his journey towards the Misty Forest. It is early morning. Several weeks it had taken him to arrive, despite starting his journey from the well-connected and fairly nearby *Waterdeep*.

Brutus reaches the Misty Forest and ventures inside. It seems a mysterious, lonely place, but with indications that it is not completely deserted. Folks in the nearby town *Daggerford* had mentioned to Brutus reports of bandits using the forest as their hideout, lizardmen in caves, as well as Orcs looking for lumber who travel down from *The High Moor* semi-regularly.

Not long into the forest, and Brutus is approached by a man wearing fine clothes. He introduces himself as **Steldun**, a servant of *Duke Heartthorne*. He wields a silver rapier, and possesses sturdy looking boots and overclothes, despite his otherwise fine attire.

Steldun instructs Brutus to follow, and leads him deeper into the wood. Eventually they arrive at the Manor of the Duke. It is located in a large clearing in the forest, and is as opulent as expected. Guards in shining plate armour are visible from the permimeter of the well kept gardens.

Steldun leads Brutus not through the front gates, but to a back entrance which leads to the Servant's Quarters. In the servant's quarters, Brutus meets the rest of the adventurers who have been conscripted for the Duke's task. There they are instructed to wait while Steldun fetches the Duke.

### The Adventurers

Although not all of the party reveal much about themselves, the party members do learn some key aspects:

#### Brutus
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E4K6E1I.jpg" alt="Brutus" style="width:300px;"/>

- Brutus is massive in stature, despite having the facial and bone structures of a halfling. He appears a grotesque and horrifying sight. 
- It is clear from his speech and interactions with *Tide* that he clearly has some sort of pirate background, and knows Tide in particular from some point in his past.
- He seizes on the opportunity to drink rum once Steldun leaves the room, but does seem willing to share with the other adventurers.

#### Tide

- Tide is a distinctive looking character, belonging to the race of Water Genasi. He looks as if he has just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on his skin and hair. He smells of fresh rain and clean water. He has blue skin and have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in colour. His hair floats freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. 
- Tide is clearly an obstinate character, and argues with Steldun incessantly whilst he is trying to explain the Duke's commands.


#### Dally "The Knife"

- Referring to himself as "The Knife", Dally is a human, lean and grim looking. His face is dark and criss-crossed with scars.
- He does not engage with the rest of the party as much when Brutus brings out his rum, instead he waits impatiently for Steldun to return.

#### Tansin Softclover

- Not much is known of Tansin currently, he sits quietly and chooses not to engage much with the others, who he appears distrustful of.
- He is clearly a wood elf, and his clothes indicate a humble background, perhaps a monk.

#### Betty Sweetcheeks

- Betty appears to be a rock gnome, and is at once at ease with the rest of the adventurers, engaging with them enthusiastically.
- Betty is clearly an alcoholic, and leaps on the opportunity to "share" Brutus's rum the second Steldun leaves the room.
- Betty mentions her obsession with a mysterious person, who she is looking forward to meeting once again.

### The Duke's Offer

Whilst Steldun is away, the party hears strange noises from behind the door he left from.

Steldun soon returns and is not satisfied with the inebriated, drunken state that many of the party members have already found themselves in. He regrets to inform the party that the Duke is choosing to entertain his guests rather than come in person, who are of course much more influential and important than they are.

Instead, Steldun presents the adventurers with personal notes from the Duke, who outlines in more detail the reward for fulfilling his task. Many of the group find the offer deeply enticing, although Tide in particular is sceptical about the Duke's capability to deliver.

Steldun explains the task for the adventurers:

- The party needs to recover three relics for the duke that were stolen from him by those jealous of his rising influence.
- They will be a challenge to obtain, so the group will need to use all of the cunning and strength at their disposal.
- They may need to gather resources before making an attempt on obtaining an artifact. For instance, gold for bribes or magical objects to aid in the fight or heist.
- The Duke may be able to provide opportunities to work and earn rewards if they so wish to - he has various vassals and contacts in the major and minor cities of the area who might need assistance. He will get in contact with them if that occurs.

The three relics the Duke wants returned are as follows:

#### 1) The Focusing Lens of the Iris

- This peculiar glass lens is used to focus light. It is particularly hard to make, deemed irreplacable by the Duke.
- The Duke used it for astronomy, one of his many hobbies, and views the theft as a personal attack on him.
- It is believed to be in the possession by a certain **Lord Stilterton**, who lives in a large manor in *Waterdeep*. The Duke does not know if he commissioned the theft or was just being opportunistic.
- The Lord is an eccentric fellow, very wealthy, and has some inflence as part of the Lords Alliance.
- The task is to steal the lens back, or take it by force. Expect resistance either way.
- Steldun warns the group to beware of Waterdeep's criminal associations, who may not appreciate tresspassing on their domain.

#### 2) The Blood Diamond

- The Blood Diamond is a particularly valuable gemstone. Ruby red and the size of a large human fist.
- It is actually a ruby, but as most people can't tell and it looks to be cut like a diamond, people call it a diamond.
- After the gemstone was stolen, it was transported by ship to some unknown destination, but did not make it there. It was stolen by pirates, but Steldun admits it has probably been stolen by multiple pirate crews by now.
- It is believed to be located somewhere in the *Nelanther Isles*, where most of the pirate hideouts are based.
- It is large and obviously valuable by sight, which presents difficulties in transporting it.
- Steldun says the party will need to obtain some sort of sea transport and crew to get to the Nelanther Isles, or else be hijacked by pirates themselves!

#### 3) The Lightning Conductor

- Embarrassingly, the Duke's lightning conductor was stolen from the roof. Since it's capture, lightning regularly strikes the manor, causing damage and discomfort.
- The conductor was made from solid silver of especially high purity, and the Duke insists he wants this one returned.
- The original conductor was taken northward, it was last heard from by a contact in Neverwinter who had heard of it being transported.
- However, Steldun states confidentially that it may be possible to commission a new one from a dwarfhold or dwarven blacksmith. Purest silver is essential for this conductor, any fake or poor quality instrument will not be accepted, however apart from that, the Duke probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The conductor is shaped like a lightning bolt at the top.


### Steldun's Recommendations

Following Steldun's explanation of the task, it is clear that not all of the party, especially Tide, are convinced.

Steldun gives the party 10 gold each for supplies and board as they begin their journey, and a promise that each artifact will be paid for in full once they have obtained it. 

Steldun recommends starting with the Focusing Lens, as it is the closest artifact and the only one which the Duke has solid information about its' whereabouts. He recommends that the party travel to the nearby town of *Daggerford* and get in touch with a man who calls himself **Rallom the Magnificent**, altough it is said that other townsfolk call him "Rallom the Drunk". The man is a career criminal who owes the Duke a favour. He will be able to give advice on obtaining the Focusing Lens. Steldun gives the party 5 gold to bribe Rallom with.

The Knife raises concern that he will not be able to enter the city of Waterdeep easily, as he is currently in some trouble with an unnamed faction. Steldun says that this problem will need to be dealt with then, perhaps by going in disguise or arranging some sort of truce.

Finally, Steldun warns the party to be wary of the Order of the Kingfisher. There is some sort of unknown faction working against the Duke, perhaps employed by the Lord's Alliance but they have no proof of that. They may attempt to interfere with your task. Steldun instructs them not to trust anyone who bears the mark of a bird.

## The Misty Forest - Bandit Attack

The party leaves the Duke's house on the insistance of Steldun, once Tide starts rummaging empty cupboards, presumably looking for things to steal.

The party start making their way out of the forest. After an hour, they hear voices in the undergrowth nearby, after many attempts. Betty casts Faerie Fire on the unknown figures, which causes them to attack.

The figures turn out to be bandits camping out in the forest, and battle commences.

The party kills 6 Bandits and 1 Mastiff, earning 437.5XP. Some member of the party are injured.

The party finds 37 silver pieces among the bandits, along with 10 crossbow bolts and their weapons. Tansin finds a wooden chest in their camp, which is found to hold a dirty but ornate lady's dress, which he keeps.
